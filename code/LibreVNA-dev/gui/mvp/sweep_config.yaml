# Sweep configuration for the LibreVNA GUI application
#
# Frequency range (start_frequency, stop_frequency) and num_points are
# extracted from the calibration file (.cal).  This ensures the sweep
# always matches the calibration boundaries.

configurations:
  stim_lvl_dbm: -10
  avg_count: 1
  num_sweeps: 30                   # sweeps per IFBW value (default/single/continuous modes)
  ifbw_live: 50000                 # IFBW (Hz) for live-preview sweep

target:
  default:
    ifbw_values:                   # list of IFBW values (Hz) for device sanity benchmark
      - 50000

  monitor:
    ifbw_hz: 50000                 # single IFBW (Hz) for monitor mode (must be one value)
    log_interval_ms: auto          # "auto" or integer ms; "auto" = log every completed sweep
    duration_s: 0                  # 0 = continuous until Ctrl-C; >0 = stop after N seconds
    warmup_sweeps: 5               # number of sweeps used to estimate actual sweep time

# Sweep configuration for the LibreVNA GUI application
#
# Frequency range (start_frequency, stop_frequency) and num_points are
# extracted from the calibration file (.cal).  This ensures the sweep
# always matches the calibration boundaries.

configurations:
  stim_lvl_dbm: -10
  avg_count: 1
  num_sweeps: 30                   # sweeps per IFBW value
  ifbw_live: 50000                 # IFBW (Hz) for live-preview sweep

target:
  ifbw_values:                     # single int OR list of ints in Hz
    - 50000

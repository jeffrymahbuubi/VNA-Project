# Sweep configuration for script 6 (6_librevna_gui_mode_sweep_test.py)
#
# Frequency range (start_frequency, stop_frequency) and num_points are
# extracted from the calibration file (.cal) passed via --cal-file.
# This ensures the sweep always matches the calibration boundaries.

configurations:
  stim_lvl_dbm: -10
  avg_count: 1
  num_sweeps: 10                   # sweeps per IFBW value

target:
  ifbw_values:                     # single int OR list of ints in Hz
